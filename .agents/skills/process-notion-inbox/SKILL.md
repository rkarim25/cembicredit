name: process-notion-inbox
description: Autonomous Notion research inbox processing and website database dual-persistence workflow. Ingests raw analyst notes, broker decks, earnings dumps, and restructuring notes from Notion Inbox. Extracts structured issuer financials, debt structures, guidance, and news, writes database/issuers/<id>.json, appends credit_news.json, compiles SQLite credit_master.db and js/issuers_data.js, creates Notion research dossiers, prepends processed receipts to the separate Processed Research Summaries page (most recent first), whisks away processed raw inbox blocks, and deploys live to GitHub Pages. Use when the user says "process notion inbox", "process inbox", "process my inbox", "inbox dump", or invokes /process-notion-inbox.

# Process Notion Inbox — Autonomous Credit Research Intake & Website Dual-Persistence Skill

This skill provides an autonomous execution protocol for reading raw research dumps, analyst notes, earnings reports, and credit catalysts from Reza's plain Notion Inbox (`3df1d0ad-68c6-813c-9f07-e7c847880346`), extracting structured corporate credit intelligence, persisting the data directly into the **CEMBI Credit website database** (`cembicredit`), compiling the SQLite master database and web bundles, creating permanent research dossiers in Notion, prepending executive receipts to the dedicated **Processed Research Summaries page** (`3e31d0ad-68c6-8187-998a-f440604c1a21`) with **most recent data as first display**, whisking away raw text blocks, and deploying live to GitHub Pages.

## 0. Non-Negotiables & Architectural Rules

1. **The Default Dual-Persistence Rule (Mandatory)**:
   - Any data, earnings numbers, notes, broker reports, or models posted on companies **must** be stored on the website (`cembicredit`) by default as an integral part of processing any Notion inbox dump or research intake.
   - **Processing a note into Notion alone without persisting to the website database is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**
   - Every ingest must update:
     * `database/issuers/<issuer_id>.json`: Master document containing metadata, financials, capital structure, debt maturities, recovery analysis, broker models, and annotations.
     * `database/credit_news.json`: Live credit news intelligence feed.
     * Rebuild with `python scripts/build_database.py`: Compiles `database/credit_master.db` (SQLite), `database/annotations.json`, and `js/issuers_data.js`.
     * Git Commit & Push: Push immediately to `origin/main` so that updates appear live on `https://rkarim25.github.io/cembicredit/`.

2. **Plain Inbox Drop Zone (Frictionless Dump)**:
   - The Notion Inbox page (`3df1d0ad-68c6-813c-9f07-e7c847880346`) is kept 100% plain, minimal, and frictionless.
   - No large summary tables, old to-dos, or clutter reside here. It exists solely for Reza to paste text, bullets, reports, or transcripts.
   - As soon as content is processed, it is whisked away and a clean placeholder restored.

3. **Separate Summary Page (Most Recent First)**:
   - All processed receipts and research summaries are stored on a dedicated separate page:
     **`📋 Processed Research Summaries & Receipts`** (`3e31d0ad-68c6-8187-998a-f440604c1a21`).
   - **Most recent entries are always displayed first at the top** (reverse chronological order).
   - Direct reciprocal links connect the Inbox drop zone and the Summary archive with 1 click.

4. **Reza's time is the scarce resource**:
   - Never make him read a long dump or status report.
   - Present about ten lines summarizing what was processed, the key credit takeaways, and live links, followed by the decision question.

5. **Multi-Source Data Integrity**:
   - Canonical historical financials (Revenue, Cash, Gross Debt) must never be silently overwritten or corrupted by conflicting broker estimates.
   - Model-derived or calculated metrics (Calculated EBITDA, FCF identity, broker consensus) must be tagged with explicit sources.

6. **The Living Company Dossier & Historical Intelligence Standard**:
   - Whenever research or a note is ingested for an issuer (e.g. Zoren, Braskem, Aragvi):
     * Expand the existing dossier with the **most recent intelligence first**.
     * **Top of Dossier (Living 'Current Stock / Credit View')**:
       1. **Credit Verdict & Investment Stance**: Stance (Overweight / Neutral / Underweight / Distressed Hold), Indicative Market Price, Target Price, YTM, Spread (bps), and concise desk executive thesis summary.
       2. **Positives (Key Credit Strengths)**: Core asset collateral, hard-currency cash flow floors (e.g. YEKDEM), regulated monopoly tariffs, market share moats.
       3. **Negatives (Key Credit Risks & Subordination)**: Structural subordination (HoldCo vs OpCo), creditor-on-creditor violence risks, upcoming regulatory/tariff cliffs, corporate governance leakage.
       4. **Background & Operational Perimeter**: Total operating capacity, asset perimeter, international stakes, parentage/ownership.
       5. **Recent Drivers & Earnings Pulse**: Normalized run-rate EBITDA, margin inflection, adviser appointments, recent facility signings, live restructuring sandbox status.
       6. **Upcoming Catalysts & Refinancing Milestones**: Explicit upcoming dates with expected credit impact (coupon dates, earnings releases, bullet maturities, regulatory cliffs).
       7. **Management Questions & Due Diligence Queue**: 4–5 sharp diligence questions with relevance and conviction triggers.
     * **Attached Interactive Tools & Models**: Direct links to attached Excel model and live interactive calculator sandbox.
     * **Sections Below (📜 Historical Notes & Chronological Intelligence Timeline)**:
       - Previous research runs, broker memos, and earlier notes are placed below the living view in **reverse chronological order** (most recent past run first).
       - Each historical note must be **explicitly demarked** with:
         * Status badge: `[Archived / Previous Note Run: <date>] — <Title>`
         * Date stamp and research source / broker tag.
         * Executive summary of the historical intake and what was concluded at that point in time.
       - Historical notes are NEVER deleted or overwritten; they preserve a clear audit trail of thesis evolution.

## 1. Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Scan & Read Plain Notion Inbox
Inspect the plain inbox page:
```powershell
python "C:\Users\Reza Karim\cembicredit\scripts\read_inbox.py"
```
Or query via Notion REST API:
- Endpoint: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/3df1d0ad-68c6-813c-9f07-e7c847880346/children?page_size=100`
- Token: Environment variable `NOTION_TOKEN_WORK` or `NOTION_TOKEN`.
- Inspect any blocks dropped below the top divider.

### Step 2: Extract & Structure Research Data
Classify the dump into:
1. **Issuer Identification**:
   - Existing issuer: Locate matching `database/issuers/<issuer_id>.json`.
   - New issuer: Generate standard metadata (`id`, `name`, `ticker`, `country`, `region`, `sector`, `rating`, `benchmark_bond`, `price`, `ytm`, `spread_bp`).
2. **Living Credit View & Up-to-Date Thesis**:
   - Construct or update the 7 structured sections (`credit_view`): Verdict, Positives, Negatives, Background, Recent Drivers, Catalysts, Management Questions.
3. **Archived Research Intake Note**:
   - Generate historical note entry (`date`, `title`, `source`, `status`: `"Archived / Previous Note Run"`, `summary`, `details`).
4. **Financials & Multi-Year P&L**:
   - Revenue, EBITDA (both Reported and Calculated Cash EBITDA).
   - Capex, Cash Interest, Working Capital changes, Taxes, and strict FCF bridge:
     `FCF = EBITDA - Capex - Cash Interest - ΔNWC - Tax`.
5. **Capital Structure & Debt Maturing Schedule**:
   - Tranche amounts, currency, coupon, maturity dates, seniority tier, and security pledges.
6. **Credit News / Catalyst Entry**:
   - Headline, summary, credit impact (`Positive`, `Neutral`, `Negative`, `Watch`), category, and clickable source URL.

### Step 3: Dual-Persistence — Website Database Update
Execute the database update and compiler:
1. Save or update `database/issuers/<issuer_id>.json`:
   - Set `issuer_doc["credit_view"] = credit_view`.
   - Prepend historical note: `issuer_doc["historical_notes"].insert(0, historical_note)`.
2. Append new event to `database/credit_news.json`.
3. Run compiler:
```powershell
python "C:\Users\Reza Karim\cembicredit\scripts\build_database.py"
```
This automatically updates:
- `database/credit_master.db` (SQLite tables: `issuers`, `financials_multi_year`, `debt_maturities`, `recovery_waterfalls`, `qualitative_annotations`, `credit_news`, `notes_search`).
- `database/annotations.json`.
- `js/issuers_data.js` (Web frontend bundle consumed by `company.html` Tab 8).

### Step 4: Notion Research Repository Sync (Living Dossier)
Update or create the structured research dossier in the Notion Research Database (`3df1d0ad-68c6-815e-b5c2-cffb3b540b1b`):
1. Use `scripts/notion_dossier_helper.py` or `scripts/process_notion_inbox.py`:
   - Prepend/update the living credit view at the top of the Notion page (most recent first).
   - Append/insert the new intake note into the `📜 Historical Notes & Chronological Intelligence Timeline` section with explicit `[Archived / Previous Note Run: <date>]` demarkation.
2. Link the generated Notion page ID into the issuer's JSON metadata (`notion_id`).

### Step 5: Prepend Receipt & Whisk Away Inbox
1. Prepend an executive receipt row to the separate **Processed Research Summaries Table** (`3e31d0ad-68c6-8114-a4ae-d197a933a2a2` on page `3e31d0ad-68c6-8187-998a-f440604c1a21`) immediately after the header row (`3e31d0ad-68c6-81db-90b9-e621b8e4eda3`) using `"after": "<header_row_id>"`:
   - Cell 1: Current Date (e.g. `22 Sep 2026`).
   - Cell 2: Company / Entity name & Ticker.
   - Cell 3: Executive bullet points summarizing key metrics, discrepancies resolved, and where the data was deployed.
2. Delete all processed raw dump blocks from the plain Notion Inbox page (`DELETE https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_id>`).
3. Restore clean placeholder block: `— Drop your text, bullets, or broker notes right here —`.

### Step 6: Commit & Deploy Live to GitHub Pages
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Reza Karim\cembicredit"
git add database/ js/issuers_data.js credit_news.json
git commit -m "Process Notion Inbox: update <company> database, compile SQLite master & sync web [Automated]"
git push origin main
```
*Note: All EM macro, corporate credit models, calculators, and database persistence belong exclusively in `cembicredit`. Never deploy credit files to `Strategy`.*

## 2. Interactive Output Format
Deliver a concise executive update (~10 lines):
1. **Inbox Dumps Ingested**: Companies / topics identified.
2. **Website Database Updated**: Confirmed update of `database/issuers/<id>.json`, `credit_master.db`, and `credit_news.json`.
3. **Key Credit Takeaways**: 2–3 highest impact data points (e.g., FCF conversion, leverage inflection, restructuring recovery).
4. **Notion Status**: Confirmed receipt prepended to top of `📋 Processed Research Summaries & Receipts` and raw inbox blocks whisked away.
5. **Live Links**: Direct link to the company drawer on `https://rkarim25.github.io/cembicredit/` or Notion dossier.
